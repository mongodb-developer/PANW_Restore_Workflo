# PANW quick restore at DB Level ðŸ§¹
Step by step guide to quick DB level restore 

Example Commands
Backup a Specific Database:
```
mongodump --db yourDatabase --out /path/to/backup/
```
Restore a Specific Database:
```
mongorestore --db yourDatabase --drop /path/to/backup/yourDatabase
```
Using Change Streams for Minimizing Downtime
To minimize downtime while restoring a specific database, you can use Change Streams to capture changes during the restore process and replay them afterward, similar to the previous explanation. Here's how you can integrate this with a per-database restore:

Start Change Stream for the Specific Database:
```
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

async function startChangeStream() {
  const client = new MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017');
  await client.connect();

  const db = client.db('yourDatabase');
  const changeStream = db.watch();

  let changes = [];
  changeStream.on('change', (next) => {
    // Save change events to a temporary storage for replaying later
    changes.push(next);
  });

  // Save the changeStream reference to stop it later if needed
  return { client, changeStream, changes };
}
```
Perform the Snapshot Restore for the Specific Database:
```
mongorestore --db yourDatabase --drop /path/to/backup/yourDatabase
```
Apply the Captured Changes:
```
async function applyChanges(changes) {
  const client = new MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017');
  await client.connect();

  const db = client.db('yourDatabase');

  for (const change of changes) {
    // Apply each change based on its type (insert, update, delete)
    switch (change.operationType) {
      case 'insert':
        await db.collection(change.ns.coll).insertOne(change.fullDocument);
        break;
      case 'update':
        await db.collection(change.ns.coll).updateOne(
          { _id: change.documentKey._id },
          { $set: change.updateDescription.updatedFields }
        );
        break;
      case 'delete':
        await db.collection(change.ns.coll).deleteOne({ _id: change.documentKey._id });
        break;
    }
  }
}
```
Cleanup:
```
async function cleanup(client, changeStream) {
  await changeStream.close();
  await client.close();
}
```
Full Workflow Example:
Start Change Stream and Capture Changes:
```
const { client, changeStream, changes } = await startChangeStream();
```
Restore the Specific Database:
```
mongorestore --db yourDatabase --drop /path/to/backup/yourDatabase
```
Apply Captured Changes:
```
await applyChanges(changes);
```
```
await cleanup(client, changeStream);
```
